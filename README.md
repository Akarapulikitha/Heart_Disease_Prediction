## Motivation

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early prediction can help in prevention and timely medical intervention. This project aims to build a model that assists in identifying individuals at risk.

---

## Project Overview

- Load patient health data with features like age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.  
- Cleanse and preprocess the data (handling missing values, normalization, encoding categorical variables).  
- Train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, possibly others) to predict whether a patient has heart disease.  
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

---

## Dataset

- Source: *[mention your dataset source here]* (for example UCI Heart Disease dataset or another medical data repository).  
- Key features: age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, etc.  
- Number of observations, class distribution (healthy vs diseased).  
- Data split (training, validation, testing).

---

## Features & Preprocessing

- Handle missing or inconsistent data.  
- Categorical feature encoding (one-hot, label encoding).  
- Feature scaling / normalization.  
- Possibly feature engineering (creating new variables, interactions).  

---

## Modeling

- Algorithms tried: e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, maybe Support Vector Machine.  
- Hyperparameter tuning (grid search or cross-validation).  
- Strategy for preventing overfitting (cross-validation, pruning, regularization).  

---

## Evaluation

- Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.  
- Confusion matrix.  
- Comparison between different models to pick the best.  

---

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.  
2. Place the dataset in the `data/` directory (or adjust the path in the notebook).  
3. Install the required Python packages.  
4. Run the notebook (`Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb`) to preprocess data, train models, and see results.  
5. Use model to make predictions on new patient data.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x  
- Libraries such as:  
  - `pandas`  
  - `numpy`  
  - `scikit-learn`  
  - `matplotlib` / `seaborn` for visualizations  
  - `joblib` (if saving models)  

You can install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Future Work

-Try more advanced models (e.g., gradient boosting, XGBoost, or neural networks).
-Use more features if available (e.g., imaging or longitudinal data).
-Explore model deployment as a web app or API for real-world use.
-Improve interpretability (e.g., SHAP values, LIME) to understand feature importance.
